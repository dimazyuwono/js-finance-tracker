# js-finance-tracker
Personal Project for learning JS.

## Background
The purpose of this repository is to record my progress of learning javascript as a standalone service, including git workflow, branching, etc. This learning is also using a kind of real-world use case that I usually have to do on day to day basis, which is tracking my finance expenses, etc.

## Goals
### Personal
- Create a standalone backend service that provides API
- Deploy the service to be used for personal use
- To create and understand MVC design pattern
- To understand how to design an API
### Project
- Provide APIs for balance accounts
- Provide APIs for transactions
- Provide APIs for merchants

## Tech
- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud)

I personally decide to skip the basics of JavaScript and start create backend service on using ExpressJS instead, not sure if this is a better approach or a proper way to learn JS but we'll see.
